Kyphosis Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project aimed at predicting kyphosis disease presence after a spinal surgery. The project uses a dataset provided in kyphosis.csv and implements decision tree and random forest classifiers to make predictions.

Files in the Repository

Kyphosis Prediction with Decision Trees and Random Forests.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis and modeling steps. The notebook includes data loading, exploratory data analysis, model building using decision trees and random forests, model evaluation, and predictions.
kyphosis.csv: Dataset used in the models. This dataset includes features like Age, Number of vertebrae involved, and the Start vertebrae number, along with the presence or absence of kyphosis after surgery.

Technologies Used
- Python: Primary programming language.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
